<h1>Mobile Suit Gundam: 1979</h1>
<div class="gold">
<p>The most influential piece of Mecha in the entire genre, save for other earlier shows like Tetsuijin-28, Mazinger Z, and perhaps even Astro Boy if you can count that. Mobile Suit Gundam is perhaps one of my favorite shows in all of fiction and it has certainly beated Star Wars in terms of favoritism.</p>

  <h2>Tetsuo Iron Man</h2>
	
</div>
	
<div class="container"> 
<p>A very gruesome horror movie revolving around a man with a metal virus that casues him to absorb both electronics and anything made of metal. I really want to rewatch it whenever I get the chance because it has played a role as being a source of inspiration. </p>

<p>Serves as another core show/seres. Armored Trooper VOTOMs follows a soldier by the name of Chirico Cuvie who was part of a covert operation to retrieve a "Perfect-Soldier" from an enemy base, which turned out to be ran by the same very government he swore oath to.</p>

<h4>Getter Robo</h4>
</div>
<div class="gold">
<img src="uzahra.png" height="500" width="500" alt="Getter Robo G"> 
<p>Written by Ken Ishikawa who has unfortunately departed. Getter Robo is another classic "Super Robot" manga/anime series, but I highly recommend you read the manga before watching any of the OVAs or shows. The original ones can be found online to read, but if you want, the physical volumes are available to read.</p>
<p>Recommended reading order: Getter Robo(1979), Getter Robo G, Shin Getter Robo, Getter Robo Go, and Getter Robo Arc. </p>
