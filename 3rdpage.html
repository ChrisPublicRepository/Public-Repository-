<h1>Blood(1997):I LIVE AGAIN</h1>

<p>Besides F.E.A.R, I'd say Blood occupies a decent place in my heart. A gothic/old-western/dieselpunk-ish themed First Person Shooter taking place in the 1920s, you play as a recently resurrected gunslinger by the name of Caleb, who was betrayed by the dark god Tchernobog whom he worshipped.</p>
<p>As Caleb, you have access to a reliable pool of weapons you can use to deal with cultists and monsters alike. Some, like the Pitchfork, may be considered useless, but over time, you acquire far more powerful weapons as you progress through the levels of each episode.</p>



<h2>Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines</h2>

<p>This is the game that has gotten me invested into the broader setting of the World of Darkness. VTM: Bloodlines is an RPG centered within the Vampire The Masquerade setting where you can choose and pick between 9 different Vampire clans that have their own unique abilities, stats, and dialogue options.</p>
<p>My favorite clan to have chosen from would probably be Malkavian. I am also considering playing Tremere next time around. To give a brief run down, Clan Tremere are the Vampire Blood Mages capable of using magic revolving around the control of blood for a number of defensive and offensive purposes.</p>

<h3>Fallout 2: Your Ride's Over Mutie. Time to Die</h3>
<p>Recently completed this one. Fallout 2 is the sequel to of course, Fallout 1, but there are somethings I like in two compared to one.</p>
<p>The first thing I like is the weapon variety. You see in Fallout 1, the game kind of forces you into only two end-game weapons, which encompass the Big Guns and Energy Weapons skill. That's not necessarily the case here in Fallout 2.</p>
</p>There are options for Melee Weaponry, Unarmed, Small Guns, and even Throwing if you feel very daring. The prime example of an end-game melee weapon would be the Super-Sledge, Mega Power Fist, Gauss Rifle, and Plasma Grenades.</p>
