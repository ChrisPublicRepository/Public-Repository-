<h2>Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines</h2>

<p>This is the game that has gotten me invested into the broader setting of the World of Darkness. VTM: Bloodlines is an RPG centered within the Vampire The Masquerade setting where you can choose and pick between 9 different Vampire clans that have their own unique abilities, stats, and dialogue options.</p>
<p>My favorite clan to have chosen from would probably be Malkavian. I am also considering playing Tremere next time around. To give a brief run down, Clan Tremere are the Vampire Blood Mages capable of using magic revolving around the control of blood for a number of defensive and offensive purposes.</p>
