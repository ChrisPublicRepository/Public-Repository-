<h1>Blood(1997) By Monolith Productions</h1>
</div>


<div class="container">
<p>One of the best Build engine games to have ever been made. Blood 1997 is made by one of my favorite Video-Game studios to ever exist, which is Monolith Productions.
Responsible for hits like FEAR, Shogo Mobile Armor Division, and Condemned: Criminal Origins.
Blood puts you in the eyes of an undead, revenant Gunslinger, who is on a quest of revenge against the dark god, Tchernobog and his voluminous minions.</p>

<h2>Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines</h2>
</div>

<div class="container">
<p> 


An RPG with very few equivalents in the plethora of cRPGs that exist. Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines is perhaps, one of my favorite games of all time,
and it has secured a place in my heart as being a game that is thronged with a number of choices, whilst having a rather precarious development cycle. Much 
like Fallout New Vegas, the game had a relatively short release window, resulting in developers attempting to squeeze in as much content within the game as much
as possible. This ended in the game being nearly almost cancelled, but securing a very loyal cult following. Personally speaking, I would appreciate if more publishers
would try to not cut corners with these kind of projects, so that the developers can actually finish a project they are astutely passionate about their project.

<h3>Fallout 2</h3>
</div>

<div class="container">
<p>

Obsidian/Black Isle Studio's biggest hit after Fallout 1, Neverwinter Nights, and Planescape: Torment. Fallout 2 is set directly after the events 
of the 1st game, where you now choose and customize a character who is a direct descendant of the Chosen One. Nearly a century has progressed 
after the events of the 1st game, and civilization has began to return back to the wasteland, where you now have factions like the NCR, Vault City, New Reno,
Broken Hills, and the infamous Enclave attempting to insert their own definition of an idyllic utopia into the post-apocalyptic landscape.

<h4>Mega Man X4</h4>

<div class="container">
<p>
I am proud to say that I have beaten most of the 2D Mega Man X games, barring the 6th one in which I will eventually revisit. Mega Man X4, like all of its predecessors,
is a sidescroller, 2D platformer where this time around; you can choose to play as Zero or X in a fight against a Reploid uprising led by a secondary villain known 
as the "Colonel" alongside his most trusted lieutenants Web Spider, Frost Walrus, Jet Stringray, Split Mushroom, Cyber Peacock, Magma Dragoon, and Storm Owl.

I stress the importance of also playing the 1st Mega Man X, as that is both critical in the experience itself, and understanding some of the

<h5>Cruelty Squad</h5>
</div>



<div class="container">
<p> 

An indie tactical FPS released in 2021, roughly three years ago which is quite amazing to look back upon it. Cruelty Squad, in it of itself, is a bizarre, yet 
very mechanically interesting game. Certain functions, like needing to reload by sliding the mouse down, and the high likeliness of dying within each mission 
to those playing it for the first time, can make it a tough, but in my opinion, a very rewarding game. The weapons you use throughout the game, are a mixture of 
real life cancelled prototypes which did not meet quality standards to bizarre futuristic weapons, like a gun that fires a probe that can burrow itself into the skull of its targets,
a radiation gun that leaves behind a caustic cloud, and perhaps one of the worst weapons ever produced in real life by a US firearms company. 


 As for the game itself, it is set within a dystopian, biopunk/ribofunk-esque future, you play as a contract assassin working for the eponymously named Cruelty Squad company,
 taking missions and contracts on the behest of the world's capacious number of megacorporations to secure their dominance, power, and control over the entire world. While
 there isn't a conventional narrative told through many consistent characters, or at least, a main character with a defined personality, there is a wider world told through flavor
 text and dialogue during mission briefs, and also interactions with NPC's throughout the levels you play through.
