        <p>Hello World</p>

	<p><strong>My hobbies and interests</strong>:</p>
	    
	<p style="color: green">My main interests are stargazing, anime and manga, hiking, model kit building, retro-gaming, and lately, I have been getting into paleontology whenever I have the chance. 
         Stargazing, and astronomy too, have always been very persistent in tracking the current weather conditions, time of day, just to see if the day will be conducive for star-gazing.
	Hiking is another favorite past time of mine. I wanted to go out hiking in the snow, but I was unable to, due to the very precarious weather conditions taking place for the past month
	I consider myself to be a very ardent anime and manga fan. Right now, I'm in the midst of trying to wrap up some shows and books that have been on my backlog for a while. As for retro-gaming
       , I'm in the midst of playing a game called Nocturne, and I have made it very far into the game to where I could beat it within a full sitting.</p>
