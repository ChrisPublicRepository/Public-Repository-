        <p>Hello World</p>

	<p>My hobbies and interests:</p>
	<p>My main interests are stargazing, anime and manga, hiking, model kit building, retro-gaming, and lately, I have been getting into paleontology whenever I have the chance.  </p>
	<p>Stargazing, and astronomy too, have always been very persistent in tracking the current weather conditions, time of day, just to see if the day will be conducive for star-gazing.</p>
	<p>Hiking is another favorite past time of mine. I wanted to go out hiking in the snow, but I was unable to, due to the very precarious weather conditions taking place for the past month.</p>
	<p>I consider myself to be a very ardent anime and manga fan. Right now, I'm in the midst of trying to wrap up some shows and books that have been on my backlog for a while.</p>

	<p>Retro-gaming is another favorite past-time of mine too. I'm playing a very good game called Nocturne, which is a survival-horror action game inspired by the older RE games.</p>

	<p>Model kit building is another good hobby of mine too. I have finally built a display case so I can safely keep my gunpla and other model kits I plan on making.</p>
	<p>As for paleontology, I have always had an interest in the field. I like learning about extinct species that existed in the past and my favorite dinosaur is probably the Quetzalcoaltus: named after the Aztec God of writing and the arts. </p>
