        <p>Hello World</p>

	<p>My hobbies and interests:</p>
	    
	<p>My main interests are stargazing, anime and manga, hiking, model kit building, retro-gaming, and lately, I have been getting into paleontology whenever I have the chance. 
         Stargazing, and astronomy too, have always been very persistent in tracking the current weather conditions, time of day, just to see if the day will be conducive for star-gazing.
	Hiking is another favorite past time of mine. I wanted to go out hiking in the snow, but I was unable to, due to the very precarious weather conditions taking place for the past month
	I consider myself to be a very ardent anime and manga fan. Right now, I'm in the midst of trying to wrap up some shows and books that have been on my backlog for a while.</p>

	<p>Retro-gaming is another favorite past-time of mine too. I'm playing a very good game called Nocturne, which is a survival-horror action game inspired by the older RE games.</p>

	<p>Model kit building is another good hobby of mine too. I have finally built a display case so I can safely keep my gunpla and other model kits I plan on making.</p>
	<p>As for paleontology, I have always had an interest in the field. I like learning about extinct species that existed in the past and my favorite dinosaur is probably the Quetzalcoaltus: named after the Aztec God of writing and the arts. </p>
