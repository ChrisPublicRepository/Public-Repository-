	<p>My main interests are stargazing, anime and manga, hiking, model kit building, retro-gaming, and lately, I have been getting into paleontology whenever I have the chance. 
         Stargazing, and astronomy too, have always been very persistent in tracking the current weather conditions, time of day, just to see if the day will be conducive for star-gazing.
	Hiking is another favorite past time of mine. I wanted to go out hiking in the snow, but I was unable to, due to the very precarious weather conditions taking place for the past month
	I consider myself to be a very ardent anime and manga fan. Right now, I'm in the midst of trying to wrap up some shows and books that have been on my backlog for a while. As for retro-gaming
       , I'm in the midst of playing a game called Nocturne, and I have made it very far into the game to where I could beat it within a full sitting.</p>

	    	<p>Perhaps one of the best older RPG's I've played. I'd rank it higher than the first Fallout in my earnest opinion.</p>

	    	<div class="gold">
		<p> A game critically acclaimed and loved by all for being one of the first "hybrids" between the FPS and RPG/dungeon crawling genres. 
			System Shock 1 was released on September 23rd, 1994 by Looking Glass Studio; who are the same people behind the Thief series and then went on to develop other games like Bioshhock.
			Taking place in the near-future of 2072, a corrupt CEO by the name of Edward Diego hires a hacker who is captured by private security forces, after the hacker attempted to break through
			Tri-Optimum Corporation's networks. After being captured, Edward Diego promises to let the Hacker be free if he were to hack SHODAN: the AI controlling Citadel Station, whihch was in orbit
			around Saturn, by disabling its moral and ethical restrictions. The Hacker accepts and is given a military-grade neural implant in the medical bay of Citadel Station, where the main events of the game
			begin.</p>

	<p>From the creator of the Battle Angel Alita manga or Gunnm in Japanese, is perhaps one of my favorite OVA's of all time. Battle Angel Alita is a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk dystopian anime that chronicles the same series of events as the manga, save without continuing any further after volume 1 of the manga. The manga itself is a must read in my opinion and I already own and have read the first volume of it, with me planning on to buy subsequent chapters.</p>
