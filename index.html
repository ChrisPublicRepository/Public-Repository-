	<p>My main interests are stargazing, anime and manga, hiking, model kit building, retro-gaming, and lately, I have been getting into paleontology whenever I have the chance. 
         Stargazing, and astronomy too, have always been very persistent in tracking the current weather conditions, time of day, just to see if the day will be conducive for star-gazing.
	Hiking is another favorite past time of mine. I wanted to go out hiking in the snow, but I was unable to, due to the very precarious weather conditions taking place for the past month
	I consider myself to be a very ardent anime and manga fan. Right now, I'm in the midst of trying to wrap up some shows and books that have been on my backlog for a while. As for retro-gaming
       , I'm in the midst of playing a game called Nocturne, and I have made it very far into the game to where I could beat it within a full sitting.</p>

		</div> 
	    	<div class="steel-div">
		<p> A game critically acclaimed and loved by all for being one of the first "hybrids" between the FPS and RPG/dungeon crawling genres. 
			System Shock 1 was released on September 23rd, 1994 by Looking Glass Studio; who are the same people behind the Thief series and then went on to develop other games like Bioshhock.
			Taking place in the near-future of 2072, a corrupt CEO by the name of Edward Diego hires a hacker who is captured by private security forces, after the hacker attempted to break through
			Tri-Optimum Corporation's networks. After being captured, Edward Diego promises to let the Hacker be free if he were to hack SHODAN: the AI controlling Citadel Station, whihch was in orbit
			around Saturn, by disabling its moral and ethical restrictions. The Hacker accepts and is given a military-grade neural implant in the medical bay of Citadel Station, where the main events of the game
			begin.</p>

	<div class="content">
	<p>From the creator of the Battle Angel Alita manga or Gunnm in Japanese, is perhaps one of my favorite OVA's of all time. Battle Angel Alita is a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk dystopian anime that chronicles the same series of events as the manga, save without continuing any further after volume 1 of the manga. The manga itself is a must read in my opinion and I already own and have read the first volume of it, with me planning on to buy subsequent chapters.</p>
	<p>I also highly recommend watching the OVA and even the live action movie. Normally, live action adaptations of anime are not well received, but the live-action version of Battle Angel Alita was created by James Cameron: the director of the Terminator movies.</p>

	<div class="content">
	<p>Silver Case and Michigan: Report From Hell, are  credited as being the first and perhaps best works created by Suda51: also known to be responsible for creating the No More Heroes games which has just recently had its third entry in the franchise.</p>
	<p>Killer7 is an on-rails first-person-shooter set in an early, alternate version of the 21st century, where all international disputes have been solved by a stronger version of the United Nations. All nuclear weapons have been either disarmed or launched into the Earth's atmosphere to collide with one another.</p>
	<p>Despite this superficial utopia, the world government's are far more authoritarian and have banned the Internet to prevent the spread of "harmful ideologies" from disrupting the social order. However, this has not stopped a terrorist organization known as the Heaven's Smiles from committing terrorist attacks around the world. </p>
        <p>With members of the Heaven's Smiles having subjected themselves to being infected by a strange viral pathogen, they have become virtually invisible and the only people in the world capable of killing and stopping them would be a group known as the Killer7: professional hitmen with supernatural abilities who are the only ones with the power to stop Heaven's Smiles.</p>

	</div>
	<video src="KMFDM-MoveOn.mp3" controls></video>

	<div class="content">
	<p>For a quick run down, KMFDM is a band from Hamburg, Germany that makes industrial music which combines metal and electronic sound effects. They were popular throughout the nineties and early 00's, but have remained active. The group's acronym: KMFDM, stands for Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid, which means No Pity For The Majority. </p>

	<p>Some of my favorite songs of theirs includes Virus, Beast, Stray Bullet, Flesh, Nihil, Ultra, Juke Joint Jezebel, and Free Your Hate.</p>
	


	<p>The gif I've included is from the second movie of Patlabor. I think either the first or second one was included in one of their music videos on MTV.</p>
